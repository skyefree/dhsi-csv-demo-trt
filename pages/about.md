This website is a sandbox for developing the TRT Language and Land App, a static mobile version of the existing [TRTFN GeoLive placenames map](https://trt.geolive.ca/map.html).

The Language and Land App is a collaborative project with the TRTFN Land Guardians, who "act as the eyes and ears of the TRTFN Lands Department."

## Collection Builder

This demo is based on templates from the University of Idaho Library's [Digital Collections](https://www.lib.uidaho.edu/digital/), and is built using [CollectionBuilder-CSV](https://github.com/CollectionBuilder/collectionbuilder-csv).

CollectionBuilder-CSV is a "Stand Alone" template for creating digital collection and exhibit websites using Jekyll, given:

- a CSV of collection metadata
- a folder of images, PDFs, audio, or video files

Driven by your collection metadata, the template generates engaging visualizations to browse and explore your objects.
The resulting static site can be hosted on any basic web server.

[CollectionBuilder](https://github.com/CollectionBuilder/) is an set of open source tools for creating digital collection and exhibit websites that are driven by metadata and powered by modern static web technology.
See [CB Docs](https://collectionbuilder.github.io/cb-docs/) for detailed information.
